# ArtSphere - Unleash Your Creative Expression

Welcome to ArtSphere 🖼️, a vibrant and innovative social media web app dedicated to the artistic souls of the world. Just like a painter's canvas, the platform provides a blank space for actors, musicians, writers, and visual artists to express themselves and connect with a global community that shares their passion for art and culture, developed with Next.js 13 🔼 and tailwind 🌬️.

## Project Overview

ArtSphere aims to bridge gaps in art and culture, creating an inclusive virtual sphere where creativity knows no bounds. We're more than just a Twitter replica; we're a creative hub where you can showcase your talents, collaborate with like-minded artists, and explore the endless possibilities of artistic expression.

## Getting Started 🚀

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). These endpoints can be edited in `app/api`.

The `app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
