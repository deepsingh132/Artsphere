# ArtSphere ![GitHub deployments](https://img.shields.io/github/deployments/deepsingh132/artsphere/production?label=build)


Welcome to ArtSphere üñºÔ∏è, a vibrant and innovative social media web app dedicated to the artistic souls of the world. Just like a painter's canvas, the platform provides a blank space for actors, musicians, writers, and visual artists to express themselves and connect with a global community that shares their passion for art and culture, developed with Next.js 13 üîº and tailwind üå¨Ô∏è.

## Project Overview

ArtSphere aims to bridge gaps in art and culture, creating an inclusive virtual sphere where creativity knows no bounds. It's more than just a Twitter replica; it's a creative hub where you can showcase your talents, collaborate with like-minded artists, and explore the endless possibilities of artistic expression.

## Getting Started üöÄ

First, install all the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). These endpoints can be edited in `app/api`.

The `app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
